## `STRING_AGG` function with subquery in first param not work so alternative solution is
```
WITH TaughtSubjects AS (
SELECT
	ejedts.EMPLOYEE_JOB_EXPERIENCE_DETAIL_ID,
	STRING_AGG(s.SUBJECT_NAME_BN,
	', ') AS subjects
FROM
	EMPLOYEE_JOB_EXPERIENCE_DETAIL_TAUGHT_SUBJECT AS ejedts
LEFT JOIN SUBJECT s ON
	s.SUBJECT_ID = ejedts.SUBJECT_ID
GROUP BY
	ejedts.EMPLOYEE_JOB_EXPERIENCE_DETAIL_ID
)

SELECT
	TaughtSubjects.subjects AS taughtSubjects
FROM
	EMPLOYEE_JOB_EXPERIENCE_DETAIL_LATEST ejedl
LEFT JOIN TaughtSubjects ON
	ejedl.EMPLOYEE_JOB_EXPERIENCE_DETAIL_ID = TaughtSubjects.EMPLOYEE_JOB_EXPERIENCE_DETAIL_ID
```
