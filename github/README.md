## To create a folder in a GitHub repository, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Navigate to Your Repository:
  Go to the main page of your repository on GitHub.
  
- Click on `Add File` and select `Create New File` or `Upload Files`:
  You can find the `Add file` button near the top right of your repository's main page.
  
- Specify the Folder Name:
  In the file name field, enter the folder name followed by a forward slash / and then the file name (e.g., `folder_name/file_name.txt`).
  GitHub will recognize the forward slash as an indication to create a folder.
  
- Commit New File:
  Below the file name field, you'll find an option to add a commit message. Type in a meaningful message to describe the changes you're making.
  
- Commit Changes:
  Finally, click on the "Commit new file" or "Commit changes" button at the bottom.
