## 📚 **Primary Genealogical Sources**

1. **ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn ʿUbayd Allāh al-Saqqāf**,
   *“al-Shams al-Ẓāhira fī Nasab al-Bā ʿAlawī”* (15th c.)
2. **al-ʿAydarūs**, *“al-ʿIqd al-Nabīh fī Nasab al-Bā ʿAlawī”*
3. **Imām ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿAlawī al-Ḥaddād**, *“al-Daʿwa al-Tamma”*
4. **Sayyid ʿUmar ibn ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-ʿAṭṭās**, *“Tārīkh al-Bā ʿAlawī”*
5. **Modern registries**: *Majlis al-ʿIlm Bā ʿAlawī* (Hadramawt), *Rābiṭa al-ʿAlawiyya al-ʿĀlamiyya* (Jeddah).

These sources form a continuous documentation chain from **Imām ʿAlī al-ʿUrayḍī → Aḥmad al-Muḥājir → ʿAlawī → modern Bā ʿAlawī families.**

---

## 🌍 **Why this lineage is uniquely well-preserved**

* The **Sādah Bā ʿAlawī** kept written *shajarāt* (family trees) notarized by scholars in every generation.
* Their genealogical offices in **Tarīm (Hadramawt)** and **Jeddah** issue certified lineage papers (*sijill nasab*).
* Independent historians like **Ibn Ḥajar al-ʿAsqalānī**, **Ibn al-ʿImād**, and **al-Sakhāwī** also recognized Aḥmad al-Muḥājir’s descent.
