#### 3. Sprint Progress and Blockers
- Basically, [`MBC-72`](https://jira.devsx.net/browse/MBC-72), [`MBC-126`](https://jira.devsx.net/browse/MBC-126),[`MBC-127`](https://jira.devsx.net/browse/MBC-127) are delayed because dependant backend features ([`MBC-51`](https://jira.devsx.net/browse/MBC-51),[`MBC-123`](https://jira.devsx.net/browse/MBC-123)) did not reviewed in time. When we acknowledged the tech lead that we are stuck without merging those features, then he started to review. After his comment, we checked them the other 2 days.
- In [`MBC-35`](https://jira.devsx.net/browse/MBC-35), Queries were raised in the Jira comment, but no response was received. Followed up via Slack, but got no reply. During the daily meeting, the tech lead acknowledged the comment and mentioned another developer would respond. However, clarification has not yet been received and thatâ€™s why the task is still in progress.
