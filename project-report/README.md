#### 3. Sprint Progress and Blockers
- We asked for an [approach](https://devsx.slack.com/archives/C07SP1ZQYC8/p1739862621219239) in `Slack` and then mentioned the team lead. But he didn't read it and couldn't recognize the issue properly after described again in meetings. We assume this is a lack of mobile lifecycle knowledge.
