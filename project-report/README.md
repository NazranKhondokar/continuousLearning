#### 3. Sprint Progress and Blockers
- The Ukraine Team review process has been moving slower than ideal. As a result, we currently have a couple of pull requests (PRs) pending review in the Backend, which has left our developers waiting to proceed with implementing feedback from previous PRs.
- [MBC-127](https://jira.devsx.net/browse/MBC-127) was completed 3 days ago but could not test it because it depends on [MBC-126](https://jira.devsx.net/browse/MBC-126) which is  still in review.
- They did not assign any task for one backend developer for the last 3 days.
